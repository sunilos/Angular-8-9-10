# SOSAngular

This project contains example code of Angular 6/8/10. It depicts how you can generate Angular 8 project and create components and run them.
In this example we have created two components for Welcome and Login page.

1.	Welcome page displays welcome message
1.	Login page accepts login id and password and authenticate them. After successful authentication login forwards request to Welcome page.

Angular server is started at 4200 default port and accessed from browser using http://localhost:4200 url.

Login and Welcome page are mapped and accessed by following urls:

1.	http://localhost:4200/login
1.	http://localhost:4200/welcome

See https://github.com/sunilos/SOSAngular/wiki to understand and develop the code.
